# Passing const

---

You can pass by reference/pointer/value with or without the **'const'** qualifier:

```cpp
double distance_def(const Point &point){
    return sqrt(point.x * point.x + point.y * point.y);
};
…
```

What's wrong with the following function declaration?

```cpp
double calculate_stuff(const Point point);
```

# Passing by value

---

You can pass structs \(and classes\) by value:

```cpp
double distance(Point point){
    point.x *= point.x;
    point.y *= point.y;
    return sqrt(point.x + point.y);
};
…
```
