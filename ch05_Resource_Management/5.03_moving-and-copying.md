# Moving and Copying

---

* There are 3 categories of constructors
  * Default/parameterized constructors
  * Copy constructors
  * Move constructors

### Default Constructors

* These are the constructors you are familiar with
* Used to create new objects of a class
* With resources, think of a newly acquired resource

```cpp
// Default constructor

Person a();

// Parameterized constructor
Person a("Will");
```

### Copy Constructors

* Copy constructors make copies of an object
* Copies their member variables
* Be careful when copying an object that is tied to a resource
* You can use the = operator to invoke the copy constructor

```cpp
Person a();

Person b(a);

// Copy assignment constructor
auto b = a;
```

### Move Constructors

* Move constructors take the values from the object to move from, and load them into the object to move to
* This includes resources tied to the object moved from
* They leave the moved-from object in an undefined but still destructible state. Do not reuse them unless you know what you are doing. 

```cpp
Person a();

// Move constructor
Person b1(Person("Will"));
Person b2(move(a));

// Move assignment instructor
auto c1 = move(a);
auto c2 = Person("Will");
```
