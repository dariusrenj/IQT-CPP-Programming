* You are given a _struct disc, with an int variable. You are also given three stack&lt;disc&gt; towers, source, temp dest. _
* Read in an _int n from the user, and create n number of discs, with each one's int variable numbered \[0 - n_\]. Load these in descending order to _source_.
* Your goal is to move the discs from source to dest, noting that you cannot stack a larger number disc on top of a smaller number disc and you can only move the top disc of a tower. 
* I provided you the function _Hanoi\(\)_. Try and think of an implementation of this function, and use the STL stack functions. When you are done, print the number of steps to solve to _stdout._
* Try your solution out with different values of n. Then try and determine the max number of discs.
